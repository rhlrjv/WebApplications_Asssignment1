1. Task Summary (in the To do page) visualizes and calculates % complete, days needed for a given amount of rate.
2. Cancel or delte a task using the bin button on the todo page.
3. A minimalist and clean display of work progress. With a large increment button and smaller decrement and delete button to minimize erroneous clicks.
4. In case a user accidentially marked a unit of work as completed (increment), we allow them to decrement (unmark) it.
5. CSS Styling through the application for minimalist design coded from a clean slate.
6. Dynamic creation of add to do and edit to do areas on the to do page.
7. Display of a funny and motivating message on completing all tasks :P
